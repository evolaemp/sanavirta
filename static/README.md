# sanavirta: static files

Static files comprise the front end scripts of project sanavirta. For the sake
of convenience, all static files live in this directory; the latter follows the
standard webapp structure.

CSS: built with [LESS][le] on top of [Skeleton][sk].

JS: powered by [jQuery][jq].


## Initialisation

Global dependencies: you will need [npm][np], [gulp][gu] and [bower][bo]. After
you install `npm` on your system, you should be able to install `gulp` and
`bower` globally through it:

```bash
npm install -g gulp
npm install -g bower
```

Once you have successfully configured all three of them, do something like:

```bash
npm install
bower install
gulp
```

If you do not want to make any front-end-related changes, you may stop here.


## Workflow

```bash
gulp
```

Watches for changes and updates the `build` directory correspondingly. In a
typical workflow, you would have `python manage.py runserver` and `gulp` running
simultaneously.


### Tests

There are also QUnit-powered unit tests for some of the JavaScript modules. You
can access these by pointing your browser to `/js_tests` (the django development
server has to be running, of course).
